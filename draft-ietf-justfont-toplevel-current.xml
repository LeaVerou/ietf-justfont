 <t>
      This memo serves to register and document the <spanx style="verb">font</spanx> Top Level Type,
      under which the Internet Media subtypes for representation formats for fonts may be registered. This
      document also serves as a registration application for a set of intended subtypes,
      which are representative of some existing subtypes already registered under the "application"
      tree by their separate registrations.

<section title="Introduction" anchor="intro">
    <t>
      The process of setting type in computer systems and other forms of text presentation
      systems uses fonts in order to provide visual representations of the glyphs. Just as
      with images, for example, there are a number of ways to represent the visual information
      of the glyphs. Early font formats often used bitmaps, as these could have been carefully
      tuned for maximum readability at a given size on low-resolution displays. More recently,
      scalable vector outline fonts have come into widespread use: in these fonts, the
      outlines of the glyphs are described, and the presentation system renders the outline in
      the desired position and size.</t>
    <t>
      This document defines a top-level Internet Media Type type "font" under which different
      representation formats of fonts may be registered (e.g. a bitmap or outline formats).
      <!-- not clear the rest of this paragraph is actually needed. -->
      It should be
      emphasized that, just as under the "image" top-level type one does not find registration
      for a specific image, for example, "The Night-watch" (by Rembrandt) but instead "JPEG"
      (a compressed image data representation format), so, under "font" one will not find
      "Courier" (the name of a popular font) but perhaps "TTF", "OTF" or "SFNT" (the names of
      commonly used TrueType and OpenType font formats as well as their higher-level wrapper
      format).</t>
      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
      NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and
      "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
      RFC 2119 <xref target="RFC2119"/>.</t>
</section>
<section title="Background and Justification">
    <t>Historically there has not been a registration of formats for fonts. Most recently, there
      have been several representation formats registered as MIME subtypes under the "application"
      top-level type.  However, with the rapid adoption of web fonts (based on the data
      from HTTP Archive <xref target="HTTP-Archive-Trends"/> 
      showing a huge increase in web font usage from 1% in the end of 2010
      to 50% across all sites in the beginning of 2015) custom fonts on the web have become
      a core web resource. As the in-depth analysis <xref target="Font-Media-Type-Analysis"/> shows,
      the lack of
      the intuitive top-level font type is causing significant confusion among developers - while
      currently defined font subtypes are severely under-utilized there are many more sites that
      already use non-existent (but highly intuitive) media types such as "font/woff", "font/ttf" and
      "font/truetype". At the same time, the majority of sites resort to using generic types such as
      "application/octet-stream", "text/plain" and "text/html"; or use unregistrable types
      such as "application/x-font-ttf".</t>

    <t>Contrary to our expectations, the officially defined IANA subtypes such as "application/font-woff"
      and "application/font-sfnt" see a very limited use - their adoption rates trail far behind as the
      actual use of web fonts continues to increase. The members of the W3C WebFonts WG believe
      the use of "application" top-level type is not ideal. First, the "application" sub-tree is treated
      (correctly) with great caution with respect to viruses and other active code. Secondly, the lack
      of a top-level type means that there is no opportunity to have a common set of optional attributes,
      such as are specified here. Third, fonts have a unique set of licensing and usage restrictions,
      which makes it worthwhile to identify this general category with a unique top-level type.</t>

    <t>The W3C WebFonts WG believes that the situation can be significantly improved if a set of font
      media types is registered using "font" as a dedicated top-level type. Based on the data analysis
      presented above, we believe that it is the presence of simple and highly intuitive media types
      for images that caused the widespread adoption of IANA's recommendations, where the correct
      usage of existing media types reaches over 97% for all subtypes in the "image" tree. The WG
      believes that, considering a rapid adoption of fonts on the web, the registration of the top-level
      media type for fonts along with the intuitive set of subtypes that reflect popular and widely used
      data formats would further stimulate the adoption of web fonts, significantly simplify web server
      configuration process and facilitate the proper use of IANA media type recommendations.</t>
</section>
<section title="Security considerations">
    <t>Fonts are interpreted data structures that represent collections of different tables containing
      data that represent different types of information, including glyph outlines in various formats,
      hinting instructions, metrics and layout information for multiple languages and writing systems,
      rules for glyph substitution and positioning, etc. Depending on the format used to represent the
      glyph data the font may contain TrueType, PostScript or SVG outlines and their respective hint
      instructions, where applicable. There are many existing, already standardized font table tags
      and formats that allow an unspecified number of entries containing predefined data fields for
      storage of variable length binary data. Many existing (TrueType, OpenType and OFF, SIL Graphite,
      WOFF, etc.) font formats are based on the table-based SFNT (scalable font) format which is extremely
      flexible, highly extensible and offers an opportunity to introduce additional table structures when
      needed, in a way that would not affect existing font rendering engines and text layout implementations.
      However, this very extensibility may present specific security concerns â€“ the flexibility and ease
      of adding new data structures makes it easy for any arbitrary data to be hidden inside a font file.
      There is a significant risk that the flexibility of font data structures may be exploited to hide
      malicious binary content disguised as a font data component.</t>

    <t>Fonts may contain 'hints', which are programmatic instructions that are executed by the font engine
      for the alignment of graphical elements of glyph outlines with the target display pixel grid.
      Depending on the font technology utilized in the creation of a font these hints may represent active
      code interpreted and executed by the font rasterizer. Even though hints operate within the confines
      of the glyph outline conversion system and have no access outside the font rendering engine, hint
      instructions can be, however, quite complex, and a maliciously designed complex font could cause
      undue resource consumption (e.g. memory or CPU cycles) on a machine interpreting it. Indeed, fonts
      are sufficiently complex, and most (if not all) interpreters cannot be completely protected from
      malicious fonts without undue performance penalties.</t>

    <t>Widespread use of fonts as necessary component of visual content presentation warrants that a
      careful attention should be given to security considerations whenever a font is either embedded
      into an electronic document or transmitted alongside media content as a linked resource. While
      many existing font formats provide certain levels of protection of data integrity (such mechanisms
      include e.g. checksums and digital signatures), font data formats provide neither privacy nor
      confidentiality protection internally; if needed, such protection should be provided externally.</t>
  </section>
  <section title="IANA Considerations ">
  <t>This specification requires IANA to modify the rules for the existing Internet Media Types 
  registry by adding a new font top-level type in the standards tree.</t>
  </section>
<section title="Definition and encoding">
    <t>The "font" as the primary media content type indicates that the content identified by it requires
      certain graphic subsystem such as font rendering engine (and, in some cases, text layout and shaping
      engine) to process font data, which in turn may require certain level of hardware capabilities such
      as certain levels of CPU performance and available memory. The "font" media type does not provide
      any specific information about the underlying data format and how the font information should be
      interpreted - the subtypes defined within a "font" tree will name the specific font formats.
      Unrecognized sub-types of "font" should be treated as "application/octet-stream". Implementations
      may pass unrecognized subtypes to a common font-handling system, if such system is available.</t>
  </section>
<section title="Defined subtypes">
    <t>In this section the initial entries under the top-level 'font' MIME type are documented. They also
      serve as examples for future registrations.</t>
    <t>For each subtype, an @font-face format identifer is defined. This for use with the @font-face 
    src descriptor, defined by the CSS3 Fonts specification <xref target="W3C.CR-css-fonts-3-20131003"/>.</t>

      Therefore, it would be extremely useful to clearly identify the format of the glyph outline data
      within a font using an optional parameter, and allow applications to make decisions about

		<abstract><t>This document specifies the WOFF font packaging format. This format was designed to provide lightweight, easy-to-implement compression of font data, suitable for use with CSS @font-face rules. Any properly licensed TrueType/OpenType/Open Font Format file can be packaged in WOFF format for Web use. User agents decode the WOFF file to restore the font data such that it will display identically to the input font.</t>
<t>The WOFF format also allows additional metadata to be attached to the file; this can be used by font designers or vendors to include licensing or other information, beyond that present in the original font. Such metadata does not affect the rendering of the font in any way, but may be displayed to the user on request.</t>
<t>The WOFF format is not intended to replace other formats such as TrueType/OpenType/Open Font Format or SVG fonts, but provides an alternative solution for use cases where these formats may be less optimal, or where licensing considerations make their use less acceptable.</t>

		<abstract><t>Based on experience with WOFF 1.0, which is widely deployed, this specification was developed to provide improved compression and thus lower use of network bandwidth, while still allowing fast decompression even on mobile devices. This is achieved by combining a content-aware preprocessing step and improved entropy coding, compared to the Flate compression used in WOFF 1.0.</t></abstract>
