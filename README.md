Charter:

This Working Group is chartered to define the "font" top-level media type, as per RFC6838 Section 4.2.7.

The following activities are in-scope:
- Defining criteria for "font" registrations
- Defining common parameters (or ways to accommodate them) between
  "font" registrations
- Making initial registrations in "font"

The working group will use draft-lilley-font-toplevel as a starting point.

It is expected that the group will have a liaison relationship with and see participation from members of the W3C WebFonts Working Group.

Milestones:
  Apr 2016 - Submit "font" media type definition to the IESG
